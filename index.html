    <h2>Mario: The Iconic Hero of the Mushroom Kingdom**</h2>
    <p>

Mario, the red-hatted plumber from Brooklyn, has been jumping through adventures since the early 1980s. As the face of Nintendo, he's saved Princess Peach, battled Bowser, raced go-karts, played sports, and even explored galaxies—all while maintaining his trademark mustache and charm. With his cheerful “Let’s-a go!” and loyal crew including Luigi, Yoshi, and Toad, Mario has become a global symbol of fun, imagination, and timeless gameplay.

If you're making a page about Mario, I can help you expand it with sections on his history, key games, allies, enemies, or even fun trivia! Want to add more flair?
